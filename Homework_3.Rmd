1. First question text: Myrmica lobrifons

```
Find:(\w)(\w+) (\w+)
Replace:\1 \3
```

Just \w catches the first letter of the genus, \w+ catches the species name. When replacing you use \# (Number of which find command in parentheses), in the order you would like them to be replaced.

2. The second question text:

First String    Second      1.22      3.4
Second          More Text   1.555555  2.2220
Third           x           3         124

```
Find:(\S+) \s+
Replace:\1,
```
The (\S+) collects non-whites space characters with more then a single character, this allows me to keep the words with single spaces in them with replacing \1. The \s+ allows me to take all the spaces and replace them with , .

3. The third question text:

Ballif, Bryan, University of Vermont
Ellison, Aaron, Harvard Forest
Record, Sydne, Bryn Mawr

```
Find:(\w+)\,\s(\w+)\,\s(\w+\s\w+\s\w+)
Replace:\2 \1 \(\3\)
```

Then use 

```
Find:(\w+)\,\s(\w+)\,\s(\w+\s\w+)
Replace\2 \1 \(\3\)
```
These two steps capture each word as a single group, then can be manipulated in the replace to switch the order of the names and add the parentheses, omitting the commas.

4. The forth question text:

0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3 0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3 0003 Cherokee Shuffle.mp3 0004 Walking Cane.mp3

```
Find:(\.\w+)\s*
Replace:(\1)\n
```
Then,

```
Find:(\d{4,}) (\w+\s+\w+\s+\w+\s+\w+)
Replace:\2_\1
```
next,

```
Find:(\d{4,}) (\w+\s+\w+)
Replace:\2_\1
```

This process has multiple steps, first you must add "carriage returns" between each song. To do this I captured the end of the sentence with (\.\w+)\s* , and added the carriage return with (\1)\n . Then I took the longest song name and converted it so that the number was behind the song title, but before the period. To do this I captured the 4 digits at the beginning of the title, then captured the word characters of the song and spaces after. I replaced these by switching the order of the digits and word characters and adding an _ between them.

5. The fifth question text: 

Camponotus,pennsylvanicus,10.2,44
Camponotus,herculeanus,10.5,3
Myrmica,punctiventris,12.2,4
Lasius,neoniger,3.3,55

```
Find:(\w)(\w+)\,(\w+)\,(\d+)\.\d+
Replace:\1_\3
```

In this problem the first letter must be captured, (\w), then the comma replaced by finding it, the next entire word must be saved (\w+), another comma removal, capture the first digit to remove it, and find the period and next digit to remove it, then leave out the final comma and digit.

6. The sixth question uses the same text as question 5.

```
Find:
Replace:
```

1. First question text: Myrmica lobrifons

```
Find:(\w)(\w+) (\w+)
Replace:\1 \3
```

Just \w catches the first letter of the genus, \w+ catches the species name. When replacing you use \# (Number of which find command in parentheses), in the order you would like them to be replaced.

2. The second question text:

First String    Second      1.22      3.4
Second          More Text   1.555555  2.2220
Third           x           3         124

```
Find:(\S+) \s+
Replace:\1,
```
The (\S+) collects non-whites space characters with more then a single character, this allows me to keep the words with single spaces in them with replacing \1. The \s+ allows me to take all the spaces and replace them with , .

3. The third question text:

Ballif, Bryan, University of Vermont
Ellison, Aaron, Harvard Forest
Record, Sydne, Bryn Mawr

```
Find:
Replace:
